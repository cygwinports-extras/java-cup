ldesc: "CUP is a system for generating LALR parsers from simple 
specifications. It serves the same role as the widely used program YACC 
and in fact offers most of the features of YACC. However, CUP is written 
in Java, uses specifications including embedded Java code, and produces 
parsers which are implemented in Java."
